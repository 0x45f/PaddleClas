# Paddle-Lite

[Paddle-Lite](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle-Lite) is an open-source deep learning framework designed by PaddlePaddle to make it easy to perform inference on mobile, embeded, and IoT devices.
Light Weight is reflected in the use of fewer bits to represent the weight and activation of the neural network,
which can greatly reduce the size of the model,
solve the problem of limited storage space of the terminal device,
and the inference performance is overall better than other frame.
[PaddleClas](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleClas) has used Paddle-Lite to evaluate [the performance of the mobile model](../models/Mobile.md).
For more detail of process, please refer to [Paddle-Lite documentations](https://paddle-lite.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/).
